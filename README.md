### Key Modules and Responsibilities:

*   **`src/pages/index.astro` (Frontend):**
    *   Renders the main user interface, including the love letter generation form and the display area for the generated letter.
    *   Handles client-side form submission.
    *   Communicates with the `/api/generate.json` endpoint to request letter generation.
    *   Manages loading states and displays error messages.
    *   Includes inline JavaScript for form handling and the copy-to-clipboard feature.
*   **`src/pages/api/generate.json.ts` (Backend API Endpoint):**
    *   Receives `POST` requests from the frontend containing user input.
    *   Applies **rate limiting** using the `withRateLimit` middleware to prevent abuse.
    *   Performs server-side input validation using `zod` based on `RequestSchema`.
    *   Sanitizes both the incoming user input and the outgoing AI-generated content.
    *   Constructs a prompt for the Groq AI model, incorporating a `safetyPrompt` for responsible AI use.
    *   Interacts with the `groq-sdk` to send the prompt and receive the AI-generated letter.
    *   Returns the generated letter as a JSON response or an error message.
*   **`src/lib/rate-limiter.ts` (Rate Limiting Utility):**
    *   Provides a `RateLimiter` class to track request counts per IP address within a configurable time window.
    *   `withRateLimit` is an Astro API route middleware that enforces rate limits and returns a `429 Too Many Requests` status if exceeded.
*   **`src/lib/sanitize.ts` (Sanitization Utility):**
    *   Offers `sanitizeInput` and `sanitizePrompt` functions to clean user-provided text and AI prompts, removing potentially harmful or unwanted content (e.g., HTML tags, special characters, prompt injections).
*   **`src/store.ts` (State Management):**
    *   Uses `nanostores` for simple, lightweight global state management (though currently, state is largely managed locally within `index.astro`'s script). This can be expanded for more complex global states.
*   **`astro.config.mjs` (Astro Configuration):**
    *   Configures Astro for `output: 'server'`, enabling server-side rendering.
    *   Integrates the `@astrojs/vercel` adapter, allowing deployment as a Vercel serverless function.
    *   Includes `vite` SSR configuration to prevent externalizing certain dependencies.
*   **`package.json` (Project Dependencies & Scripts):**
    *   Lists all project dependencies, including `astro`, `react`, `groq-sdk`, `zod`, `tailwindcss`, `nanostores`, and various Astro adapters.
    *   Defines scripts for development (`dev`), building (`build`), local preview (`preview`), and Cloudflare Pages deployment (`deploy`).
*   **`biome.json` (Code Quality Configuration):**
    *   Configures the Biome linter and formatter, ensuring consistent code style and identifying potential issues.

    I often find myself reminiscing about our unforgettable anniversary trip to Paris, the city of lights. Every cobbled street, every shared croissant, every stolen glance beneath the Eiffel Tower etched itself into the canvas of my soul. Those moments, bathed in the soft glow of Parisian evenings, are treasures I hold dear, testaments to the beautiful life we are building together.

    Your laughter is my favorite melody, your touch a comforting embrace I never want to leave. With you, every day is a celebration of love, a journey filled with warmth and understanding. You inspire me, challenge me, and make me a better person simply by being you.

    Thank you, my love, for every memory, every dream, and every beat of my heart that belongs to you. Here's to countless more anniversaries, countless more cities, and a lifetime filled with the profound and unwavering love we share.

    Forever yours,
    [Your Name]
    ```

## üöß Limitations, Known Issues & Future Roadmap

### Limitations

*   **AI Genericity:** While customizable, the AI might occasionally produce somewhat generic responses if very specific details are not provided or if the prompt is too broad.
*   **Context Window:** The AI model has a limited context window, which might restrict the depth or complexity of details it can incorporate effectively.
*   **Rate Limits:** The API enforces rate limiting (default: 50 requests per minute) to ensure fair usage and protect resources. Exceeding this will result in a `429 Too Many Requests` error.
*   **Safety Filters:** The AI model and the implemented `safetyPrompt` aim to prevent inappropriate content. However, no filter is foolproof, and users should exercise discretion.

### Known Issues

*   **Vercel `403 Forbidden` (Potential):** During development or specific deployment configurations, a `403 Forbidden` error with `x-vercel-challenge-token` or `x-vercel-mitigated: challenge` might occur. This usually indicates Vercel's security measures, often due to automated requests or incorrect environment configurations. Ensure your Vercel deployment has correctly configured environment variables (like `GROQ_API_KEY`) and that requests from the frontend are properly authenticated or handled by Vercel's edge functions.

### Future Roadmap

*   **Expanded Customization Options:**
    *   Allow users to specify mood, length, or specific keywords to include/exclude.
    *   Support for multiple languages.
*   **Multiple AI Model Support:** Integrate with other LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) to offer diverse generation styles.
*   **User Accounts & Saving:** Implement user authentication and allow users to save their generated letters.
*   **Sharing Functionality:** Enable easy sharing of letters via social media or email.
*   **Pre-built Templates:** Offer a selection of pre-designed letter templates for quick use.
*   **Image Generation (Optional):** Explore integrating image generation for personalized letter backgrounds or accompanying visuals.
*   **Refined UI/UX:** Continuous improvements to the user interface and overall experience.
